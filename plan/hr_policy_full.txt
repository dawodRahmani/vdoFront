CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
The Vision Development Organization (VDO) is an independent, non-profit, non-political, and non-governmental organization established in 2015 with the mission to promote prosperity, equity, and sustainable development in Afghanistan. Founded by a group of committed professional women, VDO was created to address the country’s pressing humanitarian and development challenges through strategic, community-centered initiatives.
Since its inception, VDO has been dedicated to empowering Afghan communities and improving livelihoods through interventions in key sectors such as education, advocacy, economic resilience, and health. The organization’s efforts focus on expanding access to essential services, fostering inclusion, and promoting gender equality to build a more equitable and prosperous society.
VDO’s mission is to transform challenges into opportunities by unlocking the potential of Afghanistan’s most vulnerable populations. Through innovative, needs-based programs, VDO seeks to enhance welfare, promote self-reliance, and create pathways toward a brighter and more just future for all.
To achieve its goals, VDO works through strategic partnerships, innovative programming, and grassroots engagement. By collaborating with local communities, national institutions, and international partners, the organization ensures that its initiatives are impactful, sustainable, and responsive to real community needs.
Education and Empowerment
Education lies at the heart of VDO’s mission. The organization strives to expand access to quality learning opportunities, particularly for marginalized and underserved populations. Its initiatives include constructing and rehabilitating schools, providing scholarships and educational materials, and addressing barriers that hinder access to learning. By promoting gender equality and lifelong education, VDO aims to equip children and youth with the tools to thrive and contribute to their communities.
Economic Inclusion and Resilience
VDO also prioritizes inclusive economic growth as a cornerstone of sustainable development and poverty reduction. The organization works to empower women, youth, and persons with disabilities through vocational training, entrepreneurship programs, job creation, and access to financial services. These efforts aim to remove systemic barriers, build resilience, and enable individuals to achieve economic independence and stability.
Organizational Strength and Values
VDO’s greatest asset is its diverse and skilled team of professionals with expertise in development, advocacy, education, and project management. Their commitment to social justice, ethical integrity, and community empowerment drives the organization’s success and continuous improvement.
The organization operates on key principles of community-driven development, innovation, collaboration, and accountability. VDO ensures that all initiatives are culturally sensitive, inclusive, and transparent. A strong commitment to gender equality and non-discrimination underpins every aspect of its work, reflecting VDO’s vision of a society where all individuals have equal opportunities to prosper.

Chapter 3: Recruitment 

  Guiding Principles for Recruitment  
Transparent Recruitment Process: The recruitment process should be clearly documented, with each step, from job posting to final selection, following standardized criteria. This transparency minimizes potential bias and ensures that decisions are based on merit. This could include forming a recruitment committee, conducting interviews by diverse panels, and using standardized assessment tools.

Focus on Gender Inclusivity: Given the cultural sensitivities in Afghanistan, especially regarding women's participation in the workforce, VDO adopts gender-sensitive hiring practices. This could involve setting hiring quotas for women, offering gender-segregated working spaces where necessary, or creating women-only job roles in certain areas to encourage female participation.

Local Capacity Building: VDO focuses on nurturing local talent, which could include offering internships or apprenticeships to young people, particularly those from underrepresented groups. Partnering with local universities or vocational training centers can also help create a pipeline of skilled local workers

Hiring and Recruitments Approaches
The Executive Director oversees a team of project and administrative staff responsible for managing VDO’s daily operations. Staffing levels and position types are determined based on project requirements, organizational priorities, and the availability of funding. All appointments within VDO are made under the authority of the Executive Director; however, recruitment and selection processes are carried out through appropriate levels of delegated authority in accordance with VDO’s approved policies and procedures. This structure ensures that all hiring decisions are transparent, merit-based, and compliant with donor requirements, applicable labor laws, and the organization’s commitment to accountability and good governance.
VDO follows five approaches of appointing employees for any vacant post - open competition, external referral, internal promotion and headhunting. Depending on the situation, urgency, geographical factors, and demand of specific needs/expertise, and other factors, the Executive Director will instruct and approve the implementation of the specific approach for any given vacancy.
Open Competition: 
Internal promotion is considered when suitable qualified staff members are available within VDO. This approach promotes career development, staff motivation, and retention.
The relevant supervisor and the HR Department jointly assess the position requirements and evaluate potential internal candidates against the established criteria. A formal performance assessment and skills evaluation are conducted before recommending promotion.
While the supervisor’s consent is not mandatory, their written feedback is required for decision-making. All promotions must be approved by the Executive Director or their delegate, and supported by written justification and performance documentation. This process ensures fairness, compliance, and consistency with VDO’s merit-based advancement policy. 
Internal promotion: 
Internal promotion is considered when suitable qualified staff members are available within VDO. This approach promotes career development, staff motivation, and retention.
The relevant supervisor and the HR Department jointly assess the position requirements and evaluate potential internal candidates against the established criteria. A formal performance assessment and skills evaluation are conducted before recommending promotion.
While the supervisor’s consent is not mandatory, their written feedback is required for decision-making. All promotions must be approved by the Executive Director or their delegate, and supported by written justification and performance documentation. This process ensures fairness, compliance, and consistency with VDO’s merit-based advancement policy.
Headhunting: 
 Headhunting is applied in specialized or urgent recruitment cases where open competition is impractical or time-sensitive. In such cases, VDO proactively identifies and approaches qualified candidates through reputable networks, CV databases, or professional referrals.
This approach must be formally approved in writing by the Executive Director before implementation, with justification provided by the HR Department. The selection and evaluation process must still adhere to VDO’s recruitment standards, with documentation maintained to ensure transparency and donor audit compliance.
Internal Transfer: 
Internal transfer is used when an existing employee, with a proven performance record and relevant qualifications, is reassigned to another project, department, or duty station. Transfers may be initiated to meet project needs, ensure operational continuity, or optimize human resource allocation.
No vacancy announcement is required if the employee holds a valid employment contract. Transfers must be supported by written approval from the Executive Director (or delegate) and documented through an official Transfer or Amendment Letter. The HR Department maintains all related records to ensure accountability and traceability.




Re-Hiring:  
Internal transfer is used when an existing employee, with a proven performance record and relevant qualifications, is reassigned to another project, department, or duty station. Transfers may be initiated to meet project needs, ensure operational continuity, or optimize human resource allocation.
No vacancy announcement is required if the employee holds a valid employment contract. Transfers must be supported by written approval from the Executive Director (or delegate) and documented through an official Transfer or Amendment Letter. The HR Department maintains all related records to ensure accountability and traceability.
Equal Employment Opportunity
VDO is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to all qualified individuals in all aspects of employment, including recruitment, promotion, transfer, compensation, and termination. All employment decisions are based solely on merit, qualifications, and performance, without discrimination based on race, color, gender, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sect, age, disability, or marital status.
To uphold this principle, VDO enforces the following guidelines:
Transparent Recruitment: Clear job descriptions, vacancy announcements, and selection criteria ensure fair and open competition.
Fair Compensation: Staff performing comparable duties receive equitable pay and benefits.
Objective Performance Reviews: Appraisals are conducted using standardized and job-related criteria.
Complaint Handling: Allegations of discrimination or misconduct are promptly and fairly investigated.
Diversity and Inclusion: VDO promotes a respectful and inclusive workplace, valuing diversity as a driver of innovation and equity.

The process ensures merit-based selection, alignment with organizational priorities, compliance with policies, and equal opportunity. This section provides a detailed overview of the full recruitment cycle and its steps, which are applied across all approaches; however, certain approaches may skip specific stages as appropriate. A list of steps involved is as follows:
Staff Requisition & ToR Development – Initiated by department/project manager; ED approval; approach indicated on SRF.
Vacancy Announcement – Public advertisement for open competition; internal notification for internal promotion or transfer.
Application Submission & Talent Pool Management – Applications recorded in database; proactive headhunting may occur.
Recruitment Committee Formation – Ensures fairness, evaluates candidates, maintains transparency.
Longlisting & Shortlisting – Based on ToR criteria; ED approves shortlist.
Written Test – Applicable for positions requiring assessment; may be waived for senior/urgent hires.
Interview Process – Conducted by Recruitment Committee; multiple rounds if necessary.
Selection & Decision-Making – Ranked by merit; final approval by ED.
Conditional Offer & On boarding – Conditional offer issued; contract finalized after verification.
Background Checks & Due Diligence – References, academic and employment verification, sanction clearance.
Recruitment Reporting & File Management – Comprehensive documentation maintained for audit and transparency.
Staff Requisition & ToR Development
The recruitment process is initiated when the requesting department or project manager submits a Staff Requisition Form (SRF) in coordination with the HR department. The SRF must be position-by-position based, ensuring that a separate form is completed and approved for each individual vacancy.
The SRF must provide comprehensive details, including:
Position title, location, and duration
Project affiliation and salary grade
Number of vacancies and gender preference (if applicable)
Required educational qualifications, experience, and language skills
Preferred announcement type
HR supports the process by drafting the Terms of Reference (ToR), which outlines the scope of duties, required qualifications, and competencies. Existing ToRs may be referenced, where applicable, to ensure consistency.
Both the SRF and ToR require approval from the Executive Director (ED) and must be coordinated with the Finance Department to confirm budget availability.
The SRF must also indicate the hiring approach—such as open competition, internal promotion, or headhunting—in accordance with policy guidelines (Chapter 3, Section 3.2).
Vacancy Announcement
Advertising Responsibility
HR is responsible for widely advertising all vacant positions to ensure maximum outreach. Primary channels include acbar.org and other publicly accessible platforms within Afghanistan.
Advertisements may be placed on the Acbar website, VIDO website, and VIDO social media platforms such as LinkedIn, among others, but not limited to these options.
Advertisement Durations
Urgent hires: 3-7 working days
Regular recruitment: 15 working days
Extended announcements: Up to 1 month if eligible candidates are not identified within the standard period
Field Recruitment 
Where internet access is limited, announcements may be posted physically in local communities with clear contact information for applications. Local or field hiring will be based on the local context and may not follow standard recruitment procedures, allowing flexibility to accommodate specific regional circumstances.
Internal Recruitment
Positions may be filled internally without public advertisement if the ED and HR confirm that qualified internal candidates are available.
Application Submission and Talent Pool Management
Application Submission
Applicants can submit their applications either:
By email to the official VIDO address (career@vdongo.org) 
 	or
Via the VIDO website submission form, following the instructions specified in each vacancy announcement.
Each application form shall include a data usage consent checkbox, through which applicants agree that their submitted information may be retained and considered for potential employment opportunities in other departments or roles within VIDO.
Candidate Database and Talent Pool
All applications are recorded in VDO’s candidate database for future reference.
This enables the organization to maintain a diverse and qualified talent pool beyond immediate vacancies, supporting efficient and timely recruitment.
Headhunting and Proactive Recruitment
The headhunting method may be used to proactively identify highly qualified candidates through recommendations, internal referrals, or CV database searches.
Use of headhunting requires ED and HR approval and must adhere to the principles of merit, eligibility, and fairness.
Recruitment Committee
Purpose
A Recruitment Committee is established to ensure fairness, transparency, and merit-based decision-making throughout the hiring process
Composition
The committee typically includes:
HR Representative (Chair): Oversees adherence to recruitment procedures and ensures impartiality
Technical Department Representative: Evaluates technical qualifications and competencies
Observer: Appointed by Senior Management to ensure transparency and compliance
Committee membership is aligned with the grade level of the vacancy and may be expanded for provincial or field-based recruitments. A single recruitment committee may cover multiple hires within the same project or office; therefore, one recruitment committee form will suffice for such cases. However, for each individual hiring process, all committee members must sign fresh Conflict of Interest forms to ensure transparency and impartiality. 
Responsibilities
Reviewing applications and shortlisting candidates
Conducting interviews and evaluating competencies
Verifying references and other relevant candidate information
Recommending suitable candidates to the Approving authority 
Decision-Making
The final selection of candidates rests with the approving authority as per signatory matrix, based on the Recruitment Committee’s recommendations. The Recruitment Committee shall recommend the three top-ranked candidates following the evaluation process. From these three candidates, the approving authority — as per the signatory matrix (ED, Deputy Executive Director [DD], or a delegated official) — may select and appoint any one of the top three candidates (first, second, or third) for the position.
Ethics and Confidentiality
Committee members must maintain strict confidentiality regarding all candidate information.
Any conflicts of interest must be disclosed immediately to maintain transparency and integrity.
Longlisting and Shortlisting
Review of Applications
After the vacancy closes, the Recruitment Committee, including HR and the hiring manager, reviews all applications.
A longlist is first created, followed by a shortlist based on the pre-established selection criteria outlined in the Terms of Reference (ToR) and vacancy announcement.
Approval
The shortlist must be reviewed and approved by the Approving authority as per signatory matrix before candidates proceed to the interview stage.
Shortlisting Criteria Weighting
The weighting of shortlisting criteria varies according to the position level as follows:
Notes
The selection process is guided by merit, relevance to position requirements, and organizational needs.
Any deviations from the weighting or criteria must be documented and approved by Approving authority as per Signatory Matrix.

Written Test
Preparation and Approval
The written test question bank shall be developed by technical experts in their respective fields, ensuring that the content accurately reflects the knowledge and competencies required for each position. The custody and confidentiality of the question bank shall remain under the strict and vigilant supervision of top management, specifically the Executive Director (ED) and Deputy Executive Director (DD). No other management personnel shall have access to the question bank. For each recruitment process, the ED or DD will select the specific test questions from the approved question bank to minimize the risk of leakage or unauthorized disclosure by current employees to potential candidates. HR Manager will only facilitate the process.
Purpose
Written tests are designed to assess candidate aptitude, technical skills, and job-relevant competencies where applicable.
Administration
Tests are conducted at the main office or approved provincial locations under HR supervision.
In exceptional circumstances, tests may be administered online through secure platforms (e.g., Google Forms) to ensure timely evaluation.
Waiver
The Approving authority as per signatory matrix may waive the written test based on position grading, substituting with multiple rounds of interviews as appropriate.
Record Keeping
All original test materials must be securely stored in HR files and digital archives to maintain confidentiality and compliance. 
Interview Process
Eligibility
Candidates who pass the written test or are shortlisted by the Recruitment Committee advance to the interview stage.

CHAPTER 5: STAFF ORIENTATION AND PROBATION
Staff On boarding and Orientation
Purpose
The onboarding and orientation process ensures that new employees are properly integrated into VDO’s organizational culture, policies, and operational systems, enabling them to perform effectively from the outset.
Orientation Process
Upon hire, HR coordinates a structured orientation program in collaboration with the relevant department or project to familiarize the new staff member with the organization’s mission, policies, and work environment.
Orientation Components
Introduction to organizational vision, mission, values, and culture
Overview of office rules, administrative procedures, and code of conduct
Introduction to HR, Finance, and IT systems (attendance, payroll, email, etc.)
Meeting with supervisor and team members
Review of job description, key deliverables, and reporting lines
Explanation of security, safeguarding, and workplace safety procedures
Completion and Documentation
The orientation is conducted jointly by HR and the supervisor.
Upon completion, the new staff member signs the Induction Form (Annex-10) to confirm understanding and participation.
HR files the signed form in the employee’s personnel file.
Probationary Period
Purpose
The probationary period allows both VDO and the employee to assess mutual compatibility, performance, and conduct before confirming permanent or project-based employment.
Duration
The standard probation period is three (3) months for a twelve (12)-month contract, prorated for shorter contracts:

For example, a six-month contract will have a probation period of 1.5 months.
Assessment and Confirmation
During probation, the employee’s performance, behavior, and adaptability are evaluated by the Appraisal committee using the Probation Evaluation Form (Annex-11).
The completed evaluation is submitted to HR within 15 days of probation completion.
Based on the evaluation, HR recommends one of the following actions to the Executive Director (Grade A-C) or Deputy Executive director (D-H) based on grading:
Confirmation of employment
Extension of probation (with justification)
Termination of employment
Exceptions and Conditions
Staff promoted or transferred internally are not required to undergo a new probation period.

Staff wishing to resign during probation must provide written notice period prorated with the normal notice period. Failure to comply may result in withholding of final dues and notification to ACBAR for black listing as permitted by law.
Completion
Upon successful completion and confirmation, HR Department issues a Confirmation Letter and updates the employee’s status to regular staff in the HR records and payroll system. In case of extension of probation reasons and KPI would be identified based on the pre-set criteria for appraisal, and reasonable opportunity would be given to the employee to improve on that lines so as to avoid any arbitrary decisions by committee.

CHAPTER 8: staff association 
Purpose and Role of the Staff Association at VDO
The Staff Association of VDO serves as an organized body that represents the collective interests, welfare, and rights of all employees within the organization. It acts as a bridge between the employees and the management, ensuring that staff concerns are heard and addressed while fostering a healthy, productive, and positive work environment. The primary purposes of the Staff Association include:
Representation: The association represents the views and concerns of staff in discussions with management. This includes negotiating on matters such as salaries, benefits, working conditions, and professional development opportunities.
Advocacy: It advocates for fair treatment, equity, and respect for all employees, ensuring that their voices are included in decision-making processes, particularly when it comes to HR policies that affect them directly.
Support and Welfare: The association plays a key role in promoting employee welfare, ensuring that their needs—both professional and personal—are supported. This includes addressing workplace grievances, offering assistance in times of personal or professional hardship, and working to create a balanced and supportive work environment.
Facilitating Communication: It helps in enhancing communication between the staff and management, ensuring that issues are resolved promptly and in a manner that promotes transparency and trust within the organization.
Promoting Engagement and Inclusivity: The Staff Association fosters team spirit and promotes inclusivity within the workforce. Through organized events, social activities, and team-building exercises, it works to create a sense of unity and shared purpose among staff.
Role and Responsibilities of Members of the Staff Association
The members of the Staff Association at VDO have distinct roles and responsibilities that contribute to the overall success and effectiveness of the association. These responsibilities can be broken down into several key areas:
Executive Committee Members:
President: Leads the association, represents staff in high-level discussions with management, and ensures that the association functions effectively. The President also chairs meetings and oversees the execution of the association’s plans.
Vice President: Supports the President in their duties and steps in when the President is unavailable. The Vice President may also take charge of specific initiatives or committees within the association.
Secretary: Manages all administrative functions of the association, including recording minutes during meetings, organizing schedules, and handling correspondence between the association and staff or management.
Treasurer: Oversees the financial management of the association, including handling membership fees (if applicable), organizing fundraising efforts, and ensuring transparency and accountability in financial matters.
Representation: Act as representatives for their respective departments or teams within VDO. They collect feedback and concerns from staff and bring them to the attention of the association’s leadership.
Participation in Committees: General members may serve on various subcommittees that focus on specific areas such as employee welfare, social events, professional development, or workplace safety. These committees work on targeted issues that affect the staff as a whole.
Advocacy and Communication: Members are responsible for advocating on behalf of their colleagues and ensuring that communication flows smoothly between the association, staff, and management. This includes helping to resolve conflicts, addressing grievances, and providing support to staff in need.
Operating Mechanisms within VDO
The Staff Association operates within a structured framework to ensure its effectiveness and alignment with the goals and policies of VDO. The following are the key operating mechanisms:
Regular Meetings:
The Staff Association holds regular meetings (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to discuss ongoing issues, review feedback from staff, and plan upcoming initiatives. Special meetings can be called if urgent issues arise.
These meetings may also include management representatives when necessary to discuss employee concerns or negotiate on specific issues such as salaries, benefits, or working conditions.
Grievance Handling:
The Staff Association plays an essential role in grievance handling. When staff members have complaints or concerns, the association can serve as a mediator between the employee and the management. This could involve facilitating discussions, helping employees file formal complaints, and ensuring that issues are resolved fairly.
A formal grievance handling process may be established where employees can submit their complaints in writing, which will then be addressed by the association.
Consultation and Negotiation:
The association acts as a consultative body that provides input to management on policy changes that affect employees. Before implementing new policies or changes to working conditions, management can consult with the Staff Association to gather feedback and make adjustments based on employee concerns.
The association may also engage in negotiations with management on behalf of staff regarding issues such as wage increases, benefits, or changes in work schedules.
Organizing Events and Activities:
The association is often responsible for organizing staff social events, team-building exercises, and other activities that foster a sense of community within VDO. These events are designed to boost morale, encourage teamwork, and improve overall employee satisfaction.
Annual General Meeting (AGM):
The association holds an Annual General Meeting (AGM) where all staff members are invited to participate. During the AGM, the association presents its annual report, discusses achievements and challenges, elects new executive members (if necessary), and sets priorities for the coming year.
Policy Development and Review:
The Staff Association works with the HR department and senior management to develop or review workplace policies that impact staff. This includes policies on workplace safety, diversity and inclusion, performance appraisals, and employee benefits. The association ensures that these policies are fair, transparent, and in line with both organizational goals and employee needs.
Reporting and Transparency:
To maintain trust and accountability, the Staff Association regularly reports back to employees on its activities, decisions, and financial matters. This could be done through newsletters, emails, or at staff meetings. Transparency is key to maintaining credibility and ensuring that the association is seen as a true representative of employee interests.
By maintaining a strong presence and adhering to these operational mechanisms, the Staff Association at VDO can play a vital role in enhancing employee well-being, fostering a positive workplace culture, and contributing to the overall success of the organization.


Policy Amendment and Review: 
Amendments to this Policy can be proposed by senior management and endorsed by the board.
